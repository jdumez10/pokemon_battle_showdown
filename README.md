# Pokemon Battle Showdown
This repository contains a reinforcement learning agent trained to battle in Pok√©mon Showdown using a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) approach. The goal is for the agent to learn optimal battle strategies through self-play and by challenging multiple baseline opponents such as RandomPlayer, MaxBasePowerPlayer, and SimpleHeuristicsPlayer.
